#### Everyone is talking about cryptocurrencies these days. But only few people fully understand their concepts and the potential impact they may have for monetary policy.

In the year 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto used an email list to spread his innovative idea of a digital,
decentralized and private currency. He named it Bitcoin. First off, the only adopters were computer scientists
and hackers who saw a lot of potential in Satoshi's idea and bought some Bitcoins (BTC) for less than a dollar.
By the end of 2017, BTC hit its all-time high with a price of $19,783.06 for one coin.

Since that point the price has decreased again and is now at around $3,500 which is still about 315.4% higher
than it was 5 years ago. The ECB classifies this high volatility as maybe the most serious drawback for
the currency's users because it writes in its analysis about virtual currency schemes that
_"they will at some point either have to cash back their virtual currency holdings into currency or use themto buy goods, the price of which is usually quoted in currencies and therefore unstable in the case of payments in virtual currency"._
A lot of people nowadays think of cryptocurrencies as a highly speculative investment - but that's not
what it was invented for.

## The underlying Idea behind Cryptocurrencies

The actual purpose of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin is to decentralize our monetary system for
more transparency, safety and independence. Other than classic currencies, a cryptocurrency is not
controlled by any bank or state.

According to the Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors Communiqu√© of last year's G20 summit,
cryptocurrencies have the _"potential to improve the efficiency and inclusiveness of the financial system"_.
But it's also mentioned that their focus on privacy and freedom raises serious issues like tax evasion or
money laundering.
The currencies are based on a protocol that records every transaction, participant and balance of the
currency's whole network. And here's the first big innovation: this protocol isn't stored in a central
location or computer. Every participant owns a copy of the protocol on his own device, so if one wants to
hack the currency, one must hack every single computer simultaneously.
This task is complicated by the fact that every block of transactions is virtually "chained" to the former
and next block. Thanks to this _"blockchain"_ mechanism, the hacker has to break the whole chain on every
protocol copy out there - an impossible task.
The next big feature that distinguishes cryptocurrencies from traditional currencies is the transaction method.
Cryptocurrencies can be transferred peer-to-peer (P2P), without the need of a bank or comparable institute
as a third party. That does not just mean a faster and more direct way of sending or receiving money - it's
also a lot cheaper, because there are no banking fees or charges.
The transaction simply gets saved into a new block and later verified by other participants of the network.
In a way this reminds one of Bill Gates' famous quote from the year 1994:
**"Banking is necessary, banks are not."**

## The Monetary Policy Impact

Although the above explanation may have you considering cryptocurrencies as a serious alternative for our
current money, the European Central Bank still doesn't recognize them as such.
Its reasons are clear: in traditional economic literature, there are three essential functions that money
needs to fulfill: It has to serve as a **medium of exchange**, **store of value** and **unit of account**.
Let's compare this to Bitcoin: Due to its volatility and limited acceptance in everyday life,
Bitcoin fails as value storage and exchange medium. Without fulfilling these concepts it's clearly impossible
for BTC to establish as a possible unit of account.
In contrast, the Euro fulfills all three functions of money, not least because it's controlled, managed and
regulated by the ECB. All countries of the euro area are bound by law to accept the Euro as payment.

So, what is the role of cryptocurrencies in today's monetary policy?

The ECB concluded that there were no big negative impacts on monetary policy yet, mainly owed to the
circumstance that there's currently no cryptocurrency that meets the above-mentioned economic criteria of money.
However, they remain under close surveillance, because of their potential to have an impact on the
monetary policy, price stability and finally the smooth processing of payments in the euro area.
Cryptocurrencies would have a greater impact on monetary policy, if their acceptance and user base grew.
This would be the case, for example if the people lost their trust in the Euro and substituted it by BTC or
a similar currency.

Although it's one of the main features of a cryptocurrency, the ECB also criticizes that
_"there's no single entity to be held accountable for the \[currency's\] integrity"_.

## The Future of Cryptocurrencies

Cryptocurrencies and their underlying technologies, especially the blockchain concept, have the potential
to change the world. P2P-Payments could allow a faster money transfer between people all over the world,
allowing everyone to participate in a global financial network. Issues like financial inclusion,
transparent transaction or data security are just a few of the positive effects that may result.
But as the experts of the ECB already mentioned, it's not that easy to set up a new currency or even
monetary system. The existing frameworks are strong and, in most countries, very efficient.
To get even close to the euro's level, today's cryptocurrencies first have to cure their teething problems
like the extremely high volatility.

Either Way, cryptocurrencies are an exciting discussion topic.
